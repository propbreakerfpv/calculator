# calculator
this is a educational project to teach me gleam, parser stuff and a more functional way of doing things.

### what can it do
 - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
 - parenthesis
 - input via: repl, cli args

### usage
to enter the repl
```sh
gleam run
```
to use cli args.
it will combine all the arguments into one long expression so you don't need to wory about " inless you are
using perenthesis or multiplication because they mean something to the shell
```sh
gleam run [your math expression]
```

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```
